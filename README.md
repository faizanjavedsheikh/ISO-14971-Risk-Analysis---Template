2	What does TBD stands for?		
	It stands for "To be determined"		
			
3	What is DV stands for in the sheets?		
	Data Validation sheets		
			
4	Why can't I just list harms directly in the General Sheet?		
	Having a list of Harms and their designated severity ratings ensures that the severity rating of a harm remains consistent throughout the document		
			
5	Why have a seperate sheet for Standards' Risks?		
	For tagging Hazards that derive from a Standard's clause. This helps generating a report later on to help claim device certification for certain standards, such as IEC 60601		
			
6	Why is there no Effectiveness column after derived requirements?		
	It is assumed that it is covered in a Requirements traceability matrix, containing Requirements, Test Cases & Test Runs.		
			
7	My Risk Levels don't fall under a particular range of numbers, what should I do?		
	You can map different values in the matrix such that the calculation results in a number that falls within a certain range. An example for this situation is given in DV - Risk Levels Sheet.		
			
8	Can I use it for Cybersecurity risk analysis & Use related risk analysis (URRA)?		
	I won't recommend it, as they follow a slightly different structure.		
			
9	My Dashboard colours are acting weird, why is it doing that?		
	The charts in the google sheets don't like to remember colors that they were assigned, so you might have to go to the chart settings to reassign the correct colours.
